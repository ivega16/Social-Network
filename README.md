# Social-Network

## Description

My motivation was to create a backend application that could utilize MySQL2 and Sequelize. I built this project so that data could be structured well for a database. This problem solves saving time on adding, viewing, updating, and deleting data within a platform. I learned how to use logic to meet the criteria associated with handling CRUD operations for tags, products, and categories.
